# Pirates of Fublan  
  
A 3D, multiplayer, battle royale game developed using the Unity engine.  

In this game, you incur the role of a stranded pirate on a lush, tropical island where you must confront hungry cannibals, wild beasts, and your fellow crewmates for your survival.  
  
The pirate ship has crashed into an island. You and your crewmates are now stranded. Luckily, there is a reserve boat, but it can only carry one pirate. You must battle it out against your crewmates and the creatures on the island. Only the fittest will prevail. The first to reach 5000 XP will make it out alive.
